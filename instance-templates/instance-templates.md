# Instance-Templates

* Resource you can use to create VM instances and MIGs

* Define machine type, boot disk image or container image, labels and other instance properties

* Convenient way to save VM instance configurations so you can create the same instances later

* It's not possible to update an existing template or change an instance template once created

* If the config needs to change, create a new instance template

* Global resource not bound to a zone or region

* Labels defined within an instance template are applied to all instances that will be created from that template
